		"description": "In a lot of the minigames in this title, there are spinning obstacles that you must avoid since, if you crash into them, you’ll be sent careening away in any direction. However, there’s a way to use these obstacles to your advantage. Specifically, if you’re careful enough, you can make it so that these obstacles strike you on your back after you’ve run past, which means that they will knock you forward with a burst of speed. Learning how to use these obstacles correctly can help you to turn a losing round into a resounding victory.",

		"description": "In many of the levels in Stumble Guys, you’ll notice that there are obstacles whose sole purpose is to push you away and knock you down. A lot of these obstacles move in a predictable, rhythmic pattern, so that it’s simpler to just wait and move when they retract. However, this often takes time; time that could cost you the match, especially when there are skilled players that know how to jump over the toughest obstacles.",
